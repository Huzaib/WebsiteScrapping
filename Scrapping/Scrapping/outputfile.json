I'm just\nguessing. What I'm about to offer as a possible explanation, is not\ncoming from any real knowledge of any explanation Linnaeus himself\nmay have given; or any other real knowledge of anything an expert\non Linnaeus has said.)\nThat being said, it seems to me there's a fairly obvious reason\nLinnaeus might have compared himself to Adam. Talking about ADAM,\nthe bible (Genesis 2:19-20 ESV) says:\n[19] Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast\nof the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them\nto the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man\ncalled every living creature, that was its name. [20] The man gave\nnames to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every\nbeast of the field.\nCarl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish botanist and zoologist,\ndeveloped the innovative and thoughtful system of naming the many\nreproductively, structurally, and ecologically distinct types (each\nof the different \"species,\" as we now call them, thanks to CL) of\nplants and animals, etc.; and of placing them in a hierarchical\nsystem of classification which--with the benefit of some\nimprovements in some of the principles by which biological beings\nare classified, made possible by advances in our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the diversity of forms of life--was received by\nscientists as a highly useful tool, and is widely used in the\nbiological sciences to this day.\nIn Linnaeus' system, plants and animals were given binomial (or\n\"two-name\") names, the first name giving the genus\n(the second smallest group of near relations to which a given type\nof organism is found to belong) of which a type of organism is a\nreproductively (and structurally, and functionally) distinct type.\nThe second name gives the species to which all the\nindividual plant or animal specimins belong, as first-relations,\nwhich allows them to be given a name that so clearly identifies\nwhat they are and what they are not that, for nearly all purposes,\nwe humans know what specific animal or plant type we're talking\nabout when they are referred to by their genus and, especially,\nspecies names.\nLinnaeus clever hiercharchical classificational (taxonomical)\nsystem makes it possible to take every living individual creature\nand say -- according to structural, relational, and evolutionary\n(many would say) principles -- first what is the largest\nclassificational grouping into which it can knowledgeably be placed\n(its kingdom, be it plant, animal, or (I think?) protist); and then\nwhat successively smaller classicificational groupings it can be\nfound to. The result is a very useful prospective understanding of\nwhere a creature type comes in on the tree which represents how\nclosely or distantly-related different animal- or plant- or\nprotist-types, are; how they are branched off from each other, at\nwhich point of specialization ... (speaking either of their\ndefining structures, functional modalities, and inter-reproductive\nviability; or, if you assume the truth of the\nevolutionary theory of speciation, of the\naforementioned traits and a creature-type's\npath of evolutionary development) ... are more or\nless general groupings of creatures most insightfully seen as\nrepresenting alternatives, as creature-types, to their nearest\nrelational groupings.\nApparently, whatever Linnaeus may have called himself, the\nparallel between the observant, thoughtful, and productive\n18th-century Swede, and the First Man of the Genesis-account of the\norigin of the fully human being (Adam) was striking enough that\n\"The Second Adam\" was among the many complimentary sobriquets\nLinnaeus' eminent admirers dreamed up for him.\nSo, to state it bluntly (at last!), Linnaeus found himself\nsurveying the vast diversity of distinct creature-types, and, like\nAdam, deciding--in his extremely compelling genus species\nformat--what they should be called. Whatever names Man/Adam may\nhave originally chosen for the creatures that came before him,\nafter Linnaeus (and his devoted followers), many of us, when we\nthink in terms of a creature's proper name, think: Felis Leo,\n", "The words were said by Mark Antony in Shakespeare's Julius\nCaesar, speaking at Caesar's funeral.
