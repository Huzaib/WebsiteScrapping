</value><value>Gothic literature is usually a combination of horror and
romance, begun in the mid 1760's. It can also refer to literature

I think cultures shifts the communication because culture
constitutes traditions, location, beliefs, history, and many other
factors that impact the way people communicate. When i was studying
international communications, I was amazed how much your culture
effect your communication styles. Also, I'm married to Russian
lady, and when we just started chatting on dream'marriage, I was
shocked how much collectivist cultures dependent on relations and
connections cuz in the US it all about individual rights and

</value><value>They affect the environment lots of ways, for example, building
a skyscraper where you can plant a tree can definently affect the
environment or a controlled demolitions can cause debris and dust
take away some fresh air.
If we build up rather than out, thereby increasing the
population density of an area, some of the effects are:
(1) Land is available for use other than housing the people who
live or work in the skyscraper and for businesses that are
quartered there.
(2) Some services, such as water supply, waste disposal, food
delivery, retail goods, and repair services, are more efficiently
provided.
(3) Mass transit--if that goal is sought--is feasible, as it is
not in rural, sparsely populated areas.
(4) Health facilities and educational services can be more
advanced, more varied, and more accessible than they are in rural
areas.

</value><value>A foil is a character placed beside the protagonist to bring out
his or her qualities. For instance, if one character (the foil)
treats someone poorly and the protagonist treats the same person
well, the compassion of the main character is more noticeable.
</value><value>"Watashi" is a more polite way to talk about oneself, and is
frequently used by both genders. "Ore" is used chiefly by males
(it's rarely used by females because it implies masculinity). "Ore"
can be considered rude if one says it to "superiors" (like elders
or bosses), so "watashi" is typically the safer of the two to use
in most social situations.

</value><value>Ludmilla, or more commonly, outside of English-speaking
countries, Ludmila or Lyudmila, is a girl's name of Slavic origin
(Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, etc.).
Lud means "people," while mila means "love, dear,"
making Ludmila mean "love of the people."
Perhaps the most famous person named Ludmila is Saint Ludmila, a
Bohemian princess of the 10th century. She is known as the patron
saint of Bohemia, the Czech Republic, religious converts, widows,
and duchesses.
</value><value>(I'm just speculating here, not having any familiarity (either
first-hand or hand-me-down) with any comment Linnaeus offered in
explanation of comparing himself to Adam.)
(Let me put that opening disclaimer more simply. I'm just
guessing. What I'm about to offer as a possible explanation, is not
coming from any real knowledge of any explanation Linnaeus himself
may have given; or any other real knowledge of anything an expert
on Linnaeus has said.)
That being said, it seems to me there's a fairly obvious reason
Linnaeus might have compared himself to Adam. Talking about ADAM,
the bible (Genesis 2:19-20 ESV) says:
[19] Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast
of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them
to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man
called every living creature, that was its name. [20] The man gave
names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every
beast of the field.
Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish botanist and zoologist,
developed the innovative and thoughtful system of naming the many
reproductively, structurally, and ecologically distinct types (each
of the different "species," as we now call them, thanks to CL) of
plants and animals, etc.; and of placing them in a hierarchical
system of classification which--with the benefit of some
improvements in some of the principles by which biological beings
are classified, made possible by advances in our knowledge and
understanding of the diversity of forms of life--was received by
scientists as a highly useful tool, and is widely used in the
biological sciences to this day.
In Linnaeus' system, plants and animals were given binomial (or
"two-name") names, the first name giving the genus
(the second smallest group of near relations to which a given type
of organism is found to belong) of which a type of organism is a
reproductively (and structurally, and functionally) distinct type.
The second name gives the species to which all the
individual plant or animal specimins belong, as first-relations,
which allows them to be given a name that so clearly identifies
what they are and what they are not that, for nearly all purposes,
we humans know what specific animal or plant type we're talking
about when they are referred to by their genus and, especially,
species names.
Linnaeus clever hiercharchical classificational (taxonomical)
system makes it possible to take every living individual creature
and say -- according to structural, relational, and evolutionary
(many would say) principles -- first what is the largest
classificational grouping into which it can knowledgeably be placed
(its kingdom, be it plant, animal, or (I think?) protist); and then
what successively smaller classicificational groupings it can be
found to. The result is a very useful prospective understanding of
where a creature type comes in on the tree which represents how
closely or distantly-related different animal- or plant- or
protist-types, are; how they are branched off from each other, at
which point of specialization ... (speaking either of their
defining structures, functional modalities, and inter-reproductive
viability; or, if you assume the truth of the
evolutionary theory of speciation, of the
aforementioned traits and a creature-type's
path of evolutionary development) ... are more or
less general groupings of creatures most insightfully seen as
representing alternatives, as creature-types, to their nearest
relational groupings.
Apparently, whatever Linnaeus may have called himself, the
parallel between the observant, thoughtful, and productive
18th-century Swede, and the First Man of the Genesis-account of the
origin of the fully human being (Adam) was striking enough that
"The Second Adam" was among the many complimentary sobriquets
Linnaeus' eminent admirers dreamed up for him.
So, to state it bluntly (at last!), Linnaeus found himself
surveying the vast diversity of distinct creature-types, and, like
Adam, deciding--in his extremely compelling genus species
format--what they should be called. Whatever names Man/Adam may
have originally chosen for the creatures that came before him,
after Linnaeus (and his devoted followers), many of us, when we
think in terms of a creature's proper name, think: Felis Leo,
</value><value>The words were said by Mark Antony in Shakespeare's Julius
Caesar, speaking at Caesar's funeral. Julius Caesar had been
assassinated by conspirators who felt he wanted to overturn the
Roman Republic, and make himself King.

This is part of the famous speech that begins: "Friends, Romans,
Countrymen - lend me your ears".

"The evil that men do lives after them,
The good is oft interred with their bones.
So let it be with Caesar..."

Mark Antony began by seeming to agree with the conspirators, then
turned the crowd against them.
</value><value>To develop a character foil, many parallels are drawn between
the character and his/her foil. These mostly include similarities.
However, to establish the foil, the characters are contrasted in a
more fundamental element of character, in order to more clearly
emphasise this character trait in the primary character.

</value><value>Without knowing the context, it could refer to a popular term
that came from the alernative culture of the sixties. Originating
in the film "the Graduate" came the term "plastic" and the counter
culture extrapolated the term to refer to anything "phony" (which
was made popular in Truman Capote's "Breakfast at Tiffany's"). The
baby boomers, raised in an unusual post war time of both strictness
and abundance were on the one hand fed up with the "establishment",
scared of "The Bomb" and nuclear annhilation, and indulged enough
to feel empowered to rethink and recreate alternative ways of wage
earning and lifestyles. They were fed up with "phonys" (also see
J.d. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye) and wanted to be real, and be
with real people. Nowadays they would call that "authentic" selves
and others. And is still part of Psychology and therapy, with
regards to self improvement, personal growth, etc.

</value><value>When you are writing a story you want to make the reader
experience it; not just read about it. One of the ways that writers
pull the reader in is through the use of Atmosphere. This is done
by choosing words, and using grammar that tell the reader what is
going on in the Emotions and Behavior of the characters, and not
just the physical facts.
Here are some examples:
"Gloria", Henry said, "What did you...?"
How do you feel about Henry? How do you think he sounds? Is he
happy? How do you think that Gloria will respond?
Now try this one:
"Gloria!", Henry Thundered, "What did you...?"
What do you think of Henry Now? How do you think Gloria will
respond to him? What did the writer do with words and grammar to
tell you what is going on?
How about this one:
"Gloria?", cried Henry, "What did you...?"
What do you think has happened here? Maybe Henry thinks that
Gloria has murdered the person he's looking at. Maybe Henry doesn't
want Gloria to kill Him. Maybe...you come up with something. Is
this Mysterious? Why?
Atmosphere.

</value><value>There are countless memoirs available, and from any desired
period in history. Every human being has a 'memoir' hidden inside;
a few dare to put them on paper. You might have the writing skills
of a deity. But if your memoir is like the countless memoirs that
have come before, no publisher will touch it.
Your memoir should have a serious twist or hook that will appeal
to readers. I know you are sure that yours does. But if you
research titles, you will surely find thousands that have the same
'unique' twist that you thought was original. Search, search and
search some more. Find out what kind of 'twist' accompanies the
successful memoires, and which ones turn out to be duds.
Find out what publishers are handling the kind of material you
wish to write. Make this part of the title
search--
Write some material-- the whole book if you have it in you.
And then throw it away. Literally. Re-write it, and possibly
re-write another time or two. Re-work, re-organize, re-think.
Go to your publisher's list and send a proposal in outline form
of the book as you envision it, and make sure your 'hook' is
sparkling and appealing. Send it to as many publishers as you can
afford postage for. Don't be surprised or dejected if you get
hundreds of rejections. And suck it up when the publisher that
accepts the proposal asks you to re-write all the sections that you
consider to be inspired by God himself. They weren't.

That being said, if a girl is avoiding you that usually means
that she does not want to pursue a relationship with you, and it
would be a waste of your time to persevere. Sometimes a girl is
interested in you at the beginning, and then when you get to know
each other she realizes that you have less in common than she
thought at first. This is okay. It is important to get to know a
lot of people before committing to a relationship. You should have
plenty of things in common and be able to have fun with each other.

Good prose engulfs the reader and takes ordinary sentences and
makes them into art.
Another view:
Prose is the general term for the ordinary language of everyday
life and commerce, and it is not in and of itself artistic. There
is much more boring or at least fact-based prose than there is
artistic prose. It serves as a language's work-horse, as the medium

the end.
Like that moment near the middle or end of Act 2 in any
film/play where plots are twisted, characters' motivations and
secrets are revealed, leading to new realisations, different
perspectives, and new plans. There's a whole section on film and
plot techniques in this textbook 'Manipulate Your Marker' by
Mitchell Grotte - I found it super helpful when trying to analyse
and define pivotal scenes.
</value><value>A book is titled(named) to give it identity,rank,position and

NO, there is no real difference.

</value><value>The alphabet was developed to be able to take invisible sounds made
by the human mouth and record it to visible records called letters
or the alphabet so that we are able to recognize specific sounds,
write words and make phrases. It enables humans to communicate
without talking with speech, and record things.
It was important in recording history. It was important to
traders and merchants in keeping records of their business.
The alphabet changes, progressing to make it simpler, and easier
to write and understand and also learn. It's important to write and
read in order for the human society to communicate and learn about
history.
Until the invention of writing, the only way humans had to
communicate was face to face. This prevented information from being
able to be shared with any sort of wide spread ease. There was no
way to share an expert's knowledge with more than the people he
could meet in a lifetime. Now we can learn from people that have
been dead for centuries. The printing press is considered one of
the most important inventions for its ability to share knowledge
with thousands at the same time.
The Phoenecians were the first to come up with a written
language. It consisted of symbols that look very much like today's
alphabet. As the ages went on, the Greeks and Romans added their
own symbols to the Phoenecian alphabet. Over time, the combination
of these three alphabets became what we now use today in everyday
reading and writing.

</value><value>Able to be understood; comprehensible. The opposite would be
unintelligible. "Joe's mumbling speech was unintelligible. But
David's speech was clear and intelligible."
</value><value>This would normally be 'Duff you up': to 'duff up' means to give
someone a beating. The idiom should not be confused with 'up the
duff' - which means 'pregnant'.
</value><value>When two works of literature share the same theme, one can say
that they are thematically parallel, or share a thematic
parallel.
For example, many works of Hermann Hesse, a well known German
author, share the theme of "coming of age," known in German as
"Bildungsroman."
Other coming of age novels would be "Great Expectations," by
Charles Dickens; "A Tree Grows in Broooklyn," by Betty Smith; "The
Catcher in the Rye," by J.D. Salinger, "Jane Eyre," by Charlotte
Bronte; "A Porrait of the Artist as a Young Man," by James Joyce.
Some of Hermann Hesse's coming of age novels are: "Peter
Camenzind," "Gertrude," "Beneath the Wheel," and "Klingsor's Last
Summer." Other famous Western European coming of age novels are
"The Sorrows of Young Werther," J.W.F. von Geothe; "Sentimental
Education," by Gustave Flaubert; "The Picture of Dorian Gray," by
Oscar Wilde; "The Magic Mountain," by Thomas Mann; "Invisible Man,"
by Ralph Ellison.
These novels were written in many countries, over the course of
hundreds of years-but share the same theme, or, share a
thematic parallel.
</value><value>'Avail' means 'use', either as a verb or a noun.
To avail oneself of something means to use it, for
example ' I have an umbrella if you wish to avail yourself of it' -
means 'I have an umbrella if you'd like to use it'.
In its noun form, it can be seen in the example, 'He threw water
over the burning car, but to no avail', means ' he threw water over
the burning car, but it was no use'.
Hope that makes sense.
